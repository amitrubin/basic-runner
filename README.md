# basic-runner  
My first JavaScript/CSS/HTML Game, mostly a fun experiment in the notion of a video game central loop + some basic CSS.  
Notes of clarification: 
 1. if you're at the top row and press up you will be looped to the bottom row, and vice versa. So you're never trapped.  
 2. to restart the game refresh the game (scroll down on phone)  
Play on your phone (or in your PC using the arrows) here -

# What's next (as of 22 September 2022)  
This isn't a very serious project, so this will all happen sporadically:
 - Restart button: currently restart is done by refreshing the screen. This is bad, and shouldn't be hard to fix. I just don't have time right now.  
   - Highest Player Score (I need to first change the way in which games are restarted).  
 - Sprites: The game is currently pretty ugly. I would like to replace the player square with something nicer, as well as make the walls & bonuses elegant. I'll probably use https://craftpix.net/freebies/ or something along those lines.  
 - Starting page: Mainly just instructions so you know how to play, plus credits :) (duh!). Eventually could allow a costum game difficulty etc.
 - Device Compatability: currently the game works on the PC and most mobiles, but not all, and it isn't elegant in all devices. I want to dynamically resize and re-organize elements of the HTML to work on all devices.  
 - Make the game more interesting! The bonuses I just added were nice and everything, but I could do more. This is the least priority currently, so the previous items take precedence
