# basic-runner  
My first JavaScript/CSS/HTML Game, mostly a fun experiment in the notion of a video game central loop + some basic CSS.  
Note of clarification - if you're at the top row and press up you will be looped to the bottom row, and vice versa. So you're never trapped.  
Play on your phone (or in your PC using the arrows) here -
